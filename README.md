When using opensource VLSI EDA tools, oftentimes SystemVerilog files do not work with the existing tooling. Tools exist to convert .sv files to .v files, however they appear to struggle with converting files reliant on headers with modports and custom types. This tool seeks to bridge the gap and allow for any .sv file to be synthesized by opensource tooling. 

Currently in progress.
